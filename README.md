# Task Board Starter Code

# Description 

The Task Board is a simple, Kanban-style task management web application. Users can create tasks with titles, descriptions, and deadlines. Tasks are organized into three lanes: To Do, In Progress, and Done, which users can drag and drop between. Each task is color-coded based on its deadline to help users quickly identify overdue tasks (red) or tasks nearing their deadline (yellow).

# Features

- Add tasks with titles, descriptions, and deadlines
- Drag and drop tasks between lanes
- Tasks can be deleted individually
- Color-coded tasks
- Responsive design, accessible on both desktop and mobile devices

# Technologies Used

- HTML5: Structure of the application
- CSS3: Styling and layout
- JavaScript (jQuery): Core functionality and interactivity
